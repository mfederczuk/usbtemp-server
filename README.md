## About ##

**usbtemp-server** is a server application that reads the temperature from
a [DS18B20]-compatible, 1-Wire-connected USB thermometer.

This software is specifically written to support the thermometers sold by [usbtemp.com],
though — in theory — any DS18B20-compatible device should work.
